Allmon passive agents can be applied to an application in various ways, 
making use of the tool very flexible, depending on specifics of system 
which we are going to monitor.


Main styles of passive intrumentation:
* by http filter - on servlet level
* Spring AOP - allmon namespace
* AspectJ load-time weaving - using AspectJ based config with predefined 
allmon advices
* LTW with Spring - as above but with Spring config
* in-code - direct instrumentation; very low level of instrumnetation 
by using allmon API in app code
