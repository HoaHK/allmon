We would like to introduce milestones so that we have a clear idea where the project is progressing and where we would like to see it in the future. 

While it is a statement of intent, it does not necessarily tie down the scope or creativity of the solution. This is a very broad idea based on what we plan to do. 

==0.3.0-PA (around mid Dec 2010)==
*	restructuring projects - splitting client project to smaller more specifically isolated maven projects
*	merging trunk code with allmon-mvn branch
*	solving problem of correlating entry/exit metrics
*	adding RMI method of sending metrics data from agents to aggregator (optional to jms)

==0.4.0-PA (around mid Jan 2011)==
*	introducing server-side front-end  - a set simple views to collected (raw/stored) metrics
*	implement first phase of aggregation functions (avg, count etc)
*	re-think and reserach client -side buffers

==0.5.0-PA (around mid Mar 2011)==
*	research apache-cassandra as a metrics storage
*	introducing first analyses views
*	finalise aggregation functions (avg, count etc) for the metrics
*	re-designing acquisition strategies and client-side buffers
*	implementing thread management strategies
