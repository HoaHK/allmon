= Todo List =

Priority: high (M), medium (OS), low (C); (MOSCOW - Must Ought Should Could and Won't)

Items: (code), (docs), (design), (research), (test)



= High =
  
  * (x) (research) Research in allmon potential schema models
    * (x) (code) Design and implement allmetrics and allgeneric schemas
    * (x) (test) Load test future multidimensional analysis queries, and choose which will better work with generic metrics data

  * (x/o) (design) Design generic agent API and sender which can be used for various metrics collection purposes

  * (x) (code) Finish simple scheduler for active monitoring
  * (o) (code) Finish loading mechanism in allmon-server
    * (x) (code) Load metrics data to RawMetrics
    * (o) (code) Extracting RawMetrics data and loading them to allmetrics schema
    * (o) (design) Linking entry and exit points!
    * (o) (design) Solve problem different times on remote clients - metrics events time synchronization issue!

  * (o) (design) Propose mechanism of building structures eligible for future multidimensional analysis

  * (o) (research) Introduce methods of comparing and correlating two/many metrics (mainly in time dimension)


= Medium=

  * (o) (code) Create maven/ivy scripts for dependency management
  * (o) (code) Create notification mechanism in case of fatal errors, wrong configuration, lack of vital allmon components, etc. (logging, sending emails)
  * (o) (test) Test separate allmon components in either wrong configuration scenarios or other software failures
    * (o) (test) Agent work if ActiveMQ instance is down

  * (o) (design) Design agent for client side web application user behaviour/experience monitoring 

= Low =

  * (o) (design) Create allmon logo
