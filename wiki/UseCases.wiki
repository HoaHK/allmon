= Allmon use cases and modules =
_(module/mainpackage)_

== loader/admin `(*)` ==
    - add a new fact
    - add a new dimension
    - add a new measure
    - add dimension to the fact
    - add measure to the fact
    - delete the fact
    - get a whole fact space measures

== collector/collector ==
    - collect data from db table (jdbc)
    - collect data from a file (parse file - regexp)
    - collect data from agents `(**)`

== collector/agent ==
    - aggregate and pass collected metrics data to collector (API)

== loader/loader ==
    - load data to the fact
    - load test data `(*)`
        - fill the fact by randomly generated data (parameters: fact, dimensions, measures, data statistical profile)
 
== loader/aggregator ==
    - create a fact and fill it by aggregated data of the parent fact (uses admin)

== loader/pruner ==
    - prune the fact data

== loader/validate procedures ==
    - validate fact, dimension, measure metadata
    - validate cube table data consistency
        - every point in the cube has to be defined by all dimensions and all measures in the fact

== loader/view-creator ==
    - get SQL to the fact
    - create a view (parameters: fact, dimension, measures, aggregation)

== miner/miner ==
    - correlate data by dimension (parameters: fact1, fact2, common dimension)
    - return clusters in a space (parameters: fact, list of dimensions, clustering method)


`(*)` can be used during the tool development
`(**)` agents api is a part of collector
