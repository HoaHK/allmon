= Collector =

Client-side metrics data acquisition (extraction) and transformation (aggregation).


*TODO: Add diagram of potentially supervised tiers (areas) of monitored system*


Modules:
  * Agent (Monitoring API - plug-in-able structure)
    * Active agents (actively executing/collecting metrics from monitored system)
      * JMX
      * SMTP
      * SQL query
    * Passive agents (monitoring real interaction with a system)
      * Web client-side monitoring
      * Java calls monitoring
      * Servlet/Actions classes monitoring

  * Sender (sending data by asynchronous messaging; Active MQ) 
  * Collector core (aggreagating metrics before sending to server) - sending data every 60sec (conf) or every 64kB (conf), Apache Camel
