#summary Main goals and requirements of project allmon.
#labels Phase-Requirements,Featured

= Introduction =

The main project goal is to create a generic system storing various metrics collections used for performance and availability monitoring purposes. The system also provides a set of datamining algorithms useful for performance analysis.

= Modules =

  # *[ModuleCollector Collector]* (`*`) (allmon-client) 
    * Agents - Extraction (metrics data acquisition), 
    * Aggregator - Transformation (aggregating metrics to packets) and transport to Loader
  # *[ModuleLoader Loader]* (`*`) (allmon-server)
    * MetricReceiver - Loading data to the database
    * Loader - Transforming data to allmetrics allmon schema
  # *[ModuleMiner Miner]* (`**`) 
    * Mining knowledge from collected in the database data, 
    * Statistical analysis, 
    * Correlation across set up dimensions
  # *[ModuleViewer Viewer]* (`**`) 
    * Presentation and Front-end 

(`*`) Core modules. 
(`**`) Allmon gives a set of views to the internal storage which can be used by other OLAP/BI/Reporting tools.

= Deployment and data live-cycle =

Allmon server-side can work with many distributed (remote) [ModuleCollector collectors]. Every instance of Collector can use (configurable) many set up *agents*, providing constant system(s) *active and/or passive monitoring*. Collected data are being *aggregated* and sent to allmon server. On server side *metric receiver* instance is listening for coming metrics and persists them to the database in raw form (1NF). The raw metrics are being transformed and loaded to allmetric schema by *loader*. Stored metrics can be taken by [ModuleMiner Miner] and [ModuleViewer Viewer] for further performance and availability analysis.

= Research =

  * [DataModelRnD Allmon datamodel research]

Allmon schema is designed to store different metrics values coming from various areas of monitoring infrastructure. The collected data are base for vast range of performance and availability analysis. 

  * [RnDLinks RnD Hub - Central point of the project research]

Allmon collaborates with other analytical tools for OLAP multidimensional analysis and Data Mining processing. 


  * [RnDTheoryPerformanceMonitoring Bit of Performance Monitoring Theory]

The tool can be used for production as well as for development (profiling) and QA (load testing) purposes.
