= Introduction =

The main project goal is to create a generic system storing various metrics collections used for performance and availability monitoring purposes. The system also provides a set of datamining algorithms useful for performance analysis.

= Modules and data livecycle =

  # [ModuleCollector Collector] (`*`) (allmon-client) 
    * Extraction (metrics data acquisition), 
    * Transformation (aggregating metrics to packets) and transport to Loader
  # [ModuleLoader Loader] (`*`) (allmon-server)
    * Loading data to the database
    * Transforming data to allmetrics allmon schema
  # [ModuleMiner Miner] (`**`) 
    * Mining knowledge from collected in the database data, 
    * Statistical analysis, 
    * Correlation across set up dimensions
  # [ModuleViewer Viewer] (`**`) 
    * Presentation and Front-end 

(`*`) Core modules. 
(`**`) Allmon gives a set of views to the internal storage which can be used by other OLAP/BI/Reporting tools.

= Research =

  * [DataModelRnD Allmon datamodel research]

Allmon schema is designed to store different metrics values coming from various areas of monitoring infrastructure. The collected data are base for vast range of performance and availability analysis. 

  * [RnDLinks RnD Hub - Central point of the project research]

Allmon collaborates with other analytical tools for OLAP multidimensional analysis and Data Mining processing. 


  * [RnDTheoryPerformanceMonitoring Bit of Performance Monitoring Theory]

The tool can be used for production as well as for development (profiling) and QA (load testing) purposes.
