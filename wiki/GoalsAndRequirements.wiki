= Introduction =

The main project goal is to create a generic system storing various metrics collections used for performance and availability monitoring purposes. The system also provides a set of datamining algorithms useful for performance analysis.

= Modules and data livecycle =

  # [ModuleCollector Collector] (`*`) (Metrics data acquisition, Extraction and Transformation)
  # [ModuleLoader Loader] (`*`) (Loading data to the database, Aggregating data)
  # [ModuleMiner Miner] (`**`) (Mining knowledge from collected in the database data, Statistical analysis, Correlation across set up dimensions)
  # [ModuleViewer Viewer] (`**`) (Presentation/Front-end) 

(`*`) Core modules. (`**`) Allmon gives a set of views to the internal storage which can be used by other OLAP/BI/Reporting tools.

= Research =

  * [DataModelRnD Allmon datamodel research]

Allmon schema is designed to store different metrics values coming from various areas of monitoring infrastructure. The collected data are base for vast range of performance and availability analysis. 

  * [RnDLinks RnD Hub - Central point of the project research]

Allmon collaborates with other analytical tools for OLAP multidimensional analysis and Data Mining processing. 


  * [RnDTheoryPerformanceMonitoring Bit of Performance Monitoring Theory]

The tool can be used for production as well as for development (profiling) and QA (load testing) purposes.
