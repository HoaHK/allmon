= Miner =

This component is responsible for mining knowledge from collected in allmon database data. 

Provides: 
  * Access layer to allmon database - used for viewer and other visualization tools 
  * Aggregating procedures (algorithms)
  * Statistical analysis procedures
    * Correlation across set up dimensions
      * Detecting related events in metrics of many layers of monitored systems infrastructure
  * Storing events history log
  * Data mining algorithms
    * Clusterization - hierarchical and mean-based - identifying similarities in users/methods behaviour  
    * ...

== Aggregates ==

  * Aggregated calls in days/hours
  * Aggregated calls by count of concurrent calls (in second grain)
  * ...

== Statistical analysis ==

  * Correlation
