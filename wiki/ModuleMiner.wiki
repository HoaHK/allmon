= Miner =

This component is responsible for mining knowledge from collected in allmon database data. 

Provides: 
  * Access layer to allmon database - used for viewer and other visualization tools 
  * Aggregating procedures (algorithms)
    * Pruning old metrics in allmetric storage after aggregating (saving space)
    * Algorithms
  * Statistical analysis procedures
    * Correlation across set up dimensions
  * Storing events history log
  * Data mining algorithms
    * Clusterization
    * ...

== Aggregates ==

  * Scalar metrics
        * In-time 
          * For boolean values - point to point change aggregation (very effective if changes not often)
          * 
    * ...
  * Vector metrics
    * In-time aggregation (day, hour, etc.)
      * Aggregated calls in days/hours
    * In resource/source hierarchy level aggregation 
    * Aggregated calls by count of concurrent calls (in second grain)
    * ...
      
== Statistical analysis ==

  * Correlation
    * Detecting related events in metrics of many layers of monitored systems infrastructure
    * Finding pseudo-related events (before/after) health check value change
  * Trend detection
  * Simple statistics
    * Up time (in log) 
  * ...

== Data mining ==

  * Clusterization - hierarchical and mean-based - identifying similarities in users/methods behaviour
  * Graphs of interconnections between resources and sources (who/what is using what)
  * ...
